Standard radiation atmospheres data.

**Standard radiation atmospheres**: ideal representation of the state of the Earth's atmosphere under some standard conditions (e.g. annual mean quantities above one given location on Earth or multiple similar locations), for the purpose of radiative transfer computations in Earth's atmosphere. The *standard radiation atmosphere* may either refers to the analytical/numerical model of the atmosphere or to the numeric data themselves, whether the latter were (partially) derived from the analytical model or not. Standard radiation atmospheres are usually derived from a combination of theroretical models and actual measurements.
